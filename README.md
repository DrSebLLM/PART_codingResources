# PART_codingResources
Here I will store the matlab code I have generated to work with PART data files

JsonDecoder_PARTexp.m provides an example for unpacking .json file data for an experiment
sebStairs.m can process a stimulus and a response vectors to calculate a perceptual threshold.
sebASStairs3.m is similar to sebStairs but applies to the adaptive scan (AS) algorithm (Lelo de Larrea-Mancera et al., 2023, AP&P)
